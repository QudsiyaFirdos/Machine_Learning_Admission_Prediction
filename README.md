# Machine_Learning_Admission_Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of a student's admission into a graduate program based on their academic and test scores. Logistic Regression, a classification algorithm, is used to model the relationship between the admission outcome (accepted/rejected) and features like GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, and research experience. The algorithm outputs the probability of admission, making it a suitable choice for binary classification problems like this.
